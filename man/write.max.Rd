}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Your data frame.}

\description{
Write a SaTScan max file
}
\details{
Writes the input data frame to the OS, using the .max extension.  Contents of the data
frame should be only what you want SaTScan to see.
This is a simple function that calls write.table, since SaTScan just needs ASCII files.
