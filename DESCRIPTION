Title: Tools, Classes, and Methods for Interfacing with SaTScan Stand-Alone
    Software
Description: SaTScan(TM) (http://www.satscan.org) is software for finding regions in 
    Time, Space, or Time-Space that have excess risk, based on scan statistics, and 
	uses Monte Carlo hypothesis testing to generate P-values for these regions.  The 
	rsatscan package provides functions for writing R data frames in 
	SaTScan-readable formats, for setting SaTScan parameters, for running SaTScan in 
	the OS, and for reading the files that SaTScan creates.
